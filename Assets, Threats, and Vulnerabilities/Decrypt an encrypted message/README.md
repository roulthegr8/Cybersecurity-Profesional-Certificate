# Activity: Decrypt an encrypted message


## Introduction
In this lab, you'll complete a series of tasks to obtain instructions for decrypting an encrypted file. Encryption of data in use, at rest, and in transit is critical to security functions. You'lll use the Linux skills you have learned to uncover the clues needed to decode a classical cipher, restore a file, and reveal a hidden message.

### What youâ€™ll do
- You have multiple tasks in this lab:

 - List the contents of a directory
 - Read the contents of files
 - Use Linux commands to revert a classical cipher back to plaintext
 - Decrypt an encrypted file and restore the file to its original state
