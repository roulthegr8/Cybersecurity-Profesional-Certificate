# Install-software-in-a-Linux-distribution

Activity: Install software in a Linux distribution
Introduction
In this lab, you’ll learn how to install and uninstall applications in Linux. You’ll use Linux commands in the Bash shell to complete this lab. You’ll also use the Advanced Package Tool (APT) package manager to install and uninstall the Suricata and tcpdump applications.

What you’ll do
 - You have multiple tasks in this lab:
 - Confirm APT is installed in Bash
 - Install Suricata with APT
 - Uninstall Suricata with APT
 - Install tcpdump with APT
 - Reinstall Suricata with APT

Scenario
Your role as a security analyst requires that you have the Suricata and tcpdump network security applications installed on your system.
In this scenario, you have to install, uninstall, and reinstall these applications on your Linux Bash shell. You also need to confirm that you’ve installed them correctly.

Here’s how you'll do this:
 1. First, you’ll confirm that APT is installed on your Linux Bash shell.
 2. Next, you’ll use APT to install the Suricata application and confirm that it is installed.
 3. Then, you’ll uninstall the Suricata application and confirm this as well.
 4. Next, you’ll install the tcpdump application and list the applications currently installed.
 5. Finally, you’ll reinstall the Suricata application and confirm that both applications are installed.

## Task 1. Ensure that APT is installed
