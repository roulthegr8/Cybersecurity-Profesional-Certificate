# Activity: Find files with Linux commands

## Introduction
In this lab, you’ll learn how to navigate a Linux file structure, locate files, and read file contents. You’ll use Linux commands in the Bash shell to complete these steps. 

What you’ll do
1. You have multiple tasks in this lab
2. Find your current working directory and display its contents
3. Navigate to a directory and list subdirectories
4. Display the contents of a file
5. Display the first 10 lines of a file

## Activity overview
Previously, you learned about Linux and how to communicate with the OS through the shell. You also learned how to use some of the core commands to navigate the Linux file system and read content from files it contains.
These are essential skills. For example, when investigating unauthorized access, you might navigate to and then read a user access report.
In this lab activity, you’ll navigate a Linux file structure, locate files, and read the contents of files. You’ll also need to answer a few multiple-choice questions based on the information contained in these files.
As a security analyst, it’s key that you know how to navigate, manage, and analyze files remotely via a Linux shell without a graphical user interface.

## Scenario
In this scenario, you have to locate and analyze the information of certain files located in the **/home/analyst** directory.
Here’s how you’ll do this: First, you’ll get the information of the current working directory you’re in and display the contents of the directory. Second, you’ll navigate to the reports directory and list the subdirectories it contains. Third, you’ll navigate to the users subdirectory and display the contents of the Q1_added_users.txt file. Finally, you’ll navigate to the logs directory and display the first 10 lines of a file it contains.
To complete these tasks, you'll need to use commands that you've previously learned in this course. Well, it's time to practice what you’ve learned. Let’s do this!

---------

### Task 1. Get the current directory information
 1. Display your working directory.

### Task 4. Navigate to a directory and locate a file

In this task, you must navigate to a new directory, locate a file, and examine the contents of the file.

 1. Navigate to the /home/analyst/logs directory.

## Conclusion
Great work!

You now have practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to :
1. Navigate directory structures with the cd command,
2. display the current working directory with the pwd command,
3. list the contents of a directory with the ls command, and
4. display the contents of files with the cat and head commands.
5. Navigating through directories and reading file contents are fundamental skills that you’ll often use when communicating through the shell.
